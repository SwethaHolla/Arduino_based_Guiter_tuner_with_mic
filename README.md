# Arduino_based_Guiter_tuner_with_mic

An Arduino Guiter tuner is similar to a Guiter tuner. That is it can help tune the guiter strings. In this project, arduino is used to tune a guiter whose freq is picked up by the microphone and FFT(Fourier Transformation) is applied to the signal. It converts the time domain signal to freq domain signal. Arduino is able to detect E2, A3, D3, G3, B3 and E4.

Circuit Diagram is as shown

(note: The signal generator represents mic)

Components used are: Arduino Uno, LCD 16x2, potention meter, 220ohm resister, Bread board, wires and mic.
